Tag Uploader 
====================

Archiving the code remains of [Mytago](http://hackorama.com/mytago/) tag system project from 2006.
Developed for J2ME/Symbian phones and was obsoleted by the smart phone era with better camera and processing power.

This is the code for the desktop client that selects and uploads the tag images to server.
